## Author's Notes

<p>I've known PowerShell for quite some time but never really know what it does till somebody from a discord server asked for help on how to run a script for an hour. I got curious so I researched the language up, read some stackoverflow solutions and implemented my own. But considering how newb I am to this language, I never offered the solution.</p>
